### What this is

This is my **cognitive systems notebook**.

I use it to collect ideas, summaries, and reminders related to:

* learning and recall
* thinking clearly
* habits, health, and energy
* decision-making and self-improvement

It’s written primarily for **me**, but kept open so others can browse, reuse, or adapt anything that resonates.

### What this is not

* Not a daily journal or planner
* Not a live task tracker
* Not a scientific or medical authority
* Not a curated, up-to-date guide

Some ideas here may be incomplete, outdated, or no longer things I actively practice. That’s intentional.

### How to read this

Topics here are broad and loosely structured. Expect:

* short summaries of books, talks, or articles
* heuristics and mental models
* notes that reflect where I was thinking at a given time

Depth and polish will vary. Some sections exist mainly as **memory anchors**.

### How to use this

If you’re reading this:

* treat it as a **personal lens**, not a prescription
* take what’s useful, ignore the rest
* don’t assume everything here is endorsed forever

### Intent

The goal is not to be right or current.
The goal is to **remember what I once found useful**, and to make it easy to revisit or rethink later.
