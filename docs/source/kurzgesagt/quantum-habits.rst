A. Convincing argument - exponential curve of 1.1% vs 1% over sufficiently large amount of time

B. Essentials
============================================================================

1. Cue - hacks: time and space, kickstart
Notes: (a) Find time & place where ideas work best (e.g., coffee place in the morning, sitting in a jungle, sitting beside the sea). (b) Establish rituals - without forming an obsessed. (c) Simulate if needed
2. Craving - hacks: tie with attractiveness/value system (i) piggyback on your natural craving for social recognition (be part of groups where desired behaviour is the norm) (ii) dopamine tricks - merge want + need (iii) create identity around systems instead of goals
3. Execution - hacks: (i) make it easy - break it down into quantum chunks (2 mins rule) (ii) number of invocation triumphs over cumulative time spent
4. Reward - hacks: (i) be okay with delayed gratification (ii) be okay with the reward of dopamine boost from making progress without having to form narratives around it - make it easy to measure progress, not that all of it should matter though.
