Navigating through Expectations
############################################################

- The true essence of science is to observe and understand how things work.
- Taking action is the only thing I can do. But every action is its own experiment. I can only observe and understand how the universe reacts to it and try again or use that feedback to take a different action. This mindset shifts my focus from expecting specific outcomes to embracing the process of figuring things out.
- I need to remember: as long as I'm observing, learning, and recalibrating, I'm staying true to the spirit of scientific exploration—of discovering what my life is and what it could be.
- My goal should be to spend time on doing stuff. Whether the stuff gets done or not isn't always in my control, but spending time on it always is.
- What matters most is that I am showing up. That's the only way I'd be able to find out.
- I shouldn't make the problems harder than it needs to be in the hope of an ideal solution. I gotta stop at good enough.
