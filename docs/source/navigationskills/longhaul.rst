Navigating through the Long Haul
##########################################################

- I need to just focus on getting better - no narratives attached.
- Progress will take its due time.
    - Long term: How do I measure progress over a month?
    - Short term: What makes today productive? How much can I actually do?
- Plans do need an end date.
    - On a topic: What is good enough? How long does it take to get there?
- Handling turbulence:
    - Can I use it in my favour instead of fighting to save on fuel?
    - What can I still learn from these that is transferable?
    - If I have to survive a toxic workplace
        - Toughest: Stop caring about what happens at work.
        - See how to to utilize work hours to my benefit.
        - Don't get fired.
    - If I have to grind through a topic which doesn't interest me
        - Toughest: Convince yourself that it's important.
        - Random exploration, structured deep dives, performance.
        - Go back to absolute basics if required.
- Not giving my best shot is what I'd regret.
