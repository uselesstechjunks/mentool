Navigating through Negative Thoughts
#############################################################

============================================================================
Why stories are dangerous for me?
============================================================================

- Negative thoughts are usually rooted in an event with a narrative.
- The event is real. The narrative is something my brain created.
- They might not even be verifiable, either because there's no well defined measure or the reality can only be revealed in time.
- In either case, it is a creation out of thin air. So it's okay to discard that. Just keep the event.

Switching Thoughts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Work on a realistic plan which gets me out of the situation.
- Work daily on executing the plan.
- Brown noise, classical music helps.
- Talking out loud helps.

Chemical Boosts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Getting the good juices flowing helps. Push limits in gym. Sex.
- Dopamine from achieving small milestones.
- Dopamine from external validation.
- Quick turn-off-brain poisons are the last resort.

Shutting Thoughts Down
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Putting on some loud music helps.
- Sleeping helps. If not able to sleep, physically tiring the hell out of myself helps.
