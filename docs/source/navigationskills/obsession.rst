Navigating through Obsession

(Split from "More Questions than Answers")

- Uniforms don't mean shit.
- Would these bother you in 10 years?
- The only obsession okay to have is with being better.
- It's okay to fake it for as long as you can live without the follow up.
- Stay in isolation until you can act as a human. If anyone needs to suffer for your problems it's you.
- Trick to break reinforcement—stop revisits.
- Trick to break a cycle—add an outward vector.
- Stories are the toughest to get rid of. Telling people about things creates stories.
- If your opinions matter, they'd ask. If you don't have one, say you don't.
- The best gift you can ever give or hope of getting is attention. It's not cheap.
- If you have a feeling, try to define it. See how it barks when you poke it. As you understand what really is bothering you, your brain will reroute the energy to other tasks that needs doing.
- If you're not sure what's bothering you, look at it chronologically. In human brain things are causally connected. Having all the data should make it easier to trace back to the root.
- You gotta learn how to be okay with not having answers to things. Some answers are hidden by the universe by axioms; some would take longer than your lifetime to figure out; some don't have any; some have too many; some are so complex you won't get it; some questions don't mean anything; some you'd think you know the answer to but you would never know for sure as the keys are hidden inside someone else's head. The best you can do is to recognise that you're faced with one such, so you can move on to the next question and make better use of your limited time on Earth.
- If you absolutely need to hypothise about an answer you cannot comfirm, settling for Occam's razor is the best you can do.
- One way to tackle the feeling of missing out on the path not taken is to gather a deeper, subjective, understanding of the underlying theme of things—categorise them into buckets—maybe the other paths wouldn't have taken you anywhere so drastically different—other than the uniforms perhaps.
- Nothing that I've thought of today is written in stone. It's okay to change my take on things as and when I know better.
