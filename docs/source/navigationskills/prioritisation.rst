Prioritisation
############################################################

- The value of your work is not up to you.
- Focus on what you're good at. You're most likely to
    - contribute something in that and
    - have fun along the way.
- If you think you're good at something but don't know how good, figure it out. It's a solvable problem. Finding "what's meaningful" is not.
- If you're not that good at it right now, can you be better? How better?
- If your career is orthogonal to this, split plans into
    - short term career goals
    - big picture.
- Useful litmus tests on deciding between these two right now:
        Are you being productive in whatever you're doing?
        Are you having an internal urge to crib about not getting the other thing done?
    - If any of the above is yes, can you afford not to do it right now?
    - If the above is yes, switch. Else suck it up.
