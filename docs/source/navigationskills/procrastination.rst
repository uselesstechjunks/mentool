Navigating through Procrastination
#########################################################

- Look for clues indicating a deviating attention such as (a) browsing related/unrelated stuffs (b) looking for perfectionism by listing down unnecessary prerequisites (c) rationalising postponing it by finding comfort elsewhere for the time being.
- Procrastination is driven by fear. The task is too hard - either conceptually or in terms of efforts.
- Decide whether it needs to be done. 
- If not, skip it and move on.
- If there's no way out, set time intervals. Small chunks. Just sit down and spend time on it.
