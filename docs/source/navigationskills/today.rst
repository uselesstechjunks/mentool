Navigating through Today
#####################################################
Today
- I will be focusing on ME. 
- I will be focusing on TODAY
- I will be facing what I FEAR.

- I will make today useful. I'll work on whatever I have planned. I won't be obsessing over finishing it all - as things will go random. Eventually, I will have to learn how to embrace randomness and still having the courage to have a plan to navigate through it.

- On self respect, it's not about where I am going. As long as I'm fighting despite all the setbacks, I should feel proud. I'd have respected someone who never gave up even when their backs were pressed against the wall.

- Destinations are externalities - tags decided by people. They do matter in the outside world - there's no fooling around that fact. But they are temporary and they change - largely by my effort and partially by chance. I wouldn't judge a movie only after watching half of it. I need to see how it ends.
