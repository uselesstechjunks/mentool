Monthly schedule
============================================================================

- Set monthly goals on a larger topics. Splitting it further doesn't work (for you).
- Think about how much can realistically be covered in 4 weeks.
- Keep broad but flexible weekly targets.
- Keep stricter daily target. Decide each day.

Weekly schedule
============================================================================

- Goals like "finish chapter by today" doesn't work (for you). It should just be "finish chapter". If you're making progress, it's okay, in fact, better, to spend time on one thing (more aligned with research).
- Take multiple passes through the chapter.
    - Pass 1: (a) overview.
    - Pass 2: (b) understanding important bits (c) test your understanding of basics
    - Pass 3: (c) creating a mental map (d) being able to fill in the details
    - Pass 4: (e) explain (f) exercises
    - Pass 5: (g) read other sources (h) explore questions on channels.

The process
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If you are NOT being productive on a high cognitive-demand task at the moment, you can always make progress on other tasks that have low cognitive demand.

Open questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Easy first, tough later? Or the other way around?
- Dopamine first, self loathing later? Or the other way around?
