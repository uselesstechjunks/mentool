Takeaways
========================================================================

#. Fully understand the complex topic first: Don't begin the learning process by explaining it before you actually understand it. Retention methods such as Feynman technique, active-recall and spaced repetition are for solidifying information that you already understand. Trying to solidify an information before you understand it might end up encoding wrong interpretation of a topic.
#. Consolidate the information concisely onto a flashcard/some other place for long term retention: Once we really understand a topic to be able to explain the core principles without having to use jargons, we should hold onto that understanding. Unfortunately, a large portion of that information that we just gathered is lost within first 48 hours after learning. So note it down somewhere before you lose it. Optimise for spaced-repitition for next sessions.
#. Don't write notes on notes: Life is short.
#. Choose your topics carefully: Not everything that you study suits this technique. Usually abstract complex ideas are best understood by Feynman technique but ideas that are evidence-based/observational might not really be suited for this. 
#. Actually put the time and effort: Once you have selected the correct set of topics, make sure you actually spend the time and effort to go through the entirety of the techniques. Feynman technique is great for having a basic framework of the topic inside your head with the details chopped off. It's important to get a very clear picture of the basics in your head right - the details can be filled in later.
#. Avoid jargon and complexity. The simpler the explanation, the more likely you are to remember it.
#. Use it for real: perfectly suitable for weekly tech-talks/lectures/paper-reading sessions.
#. Simplify your explanation so that YOU understand it. As long as the explanation is not simple enough for YOU to understand, spend more hours to break it down to basic, bare-bone, core ideas.
